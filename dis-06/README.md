# Higher-Order Programming

For this discussion, we'll be writing a handful of higher-order functions. 

We will cover:
- fold
- map
- reverse
- filter
- trees

Please avoid looking through the textbook while working on these exercises! You will find many of the answers there, but this will not help you learn. Give all problems an honest try on your own first. Solutions will be posted here after discussion.
